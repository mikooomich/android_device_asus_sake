# Hi.

Hi. Welcome to my playground. This is my personal LineageOS device tree for the ASUS ZenFone 8 (sake).


## Notes

Building
- [Kernel repo](https://github.com/mikooomich/android_kernel_asus_sm8350)
- [Vendor repo](https://github.com/mikooomich/proprietary_vendor_asus_sake)
- The rest are just LineagOS' repos


For more information, install instructions, and changelogs, check out the forum post. Downloads can be found in the releases section.

Branches suffixed in -staging are the testing branches where I attempt experimental things stuff and see what's sticks. Borrowing a quote from [Terminator-J](https://github.com/Terminator-J), "Warning: I force push like a cracked-out Jedi".
