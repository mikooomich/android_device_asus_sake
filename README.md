# Hi.

Hi. Welcome to my playground. This is my personal LineageOS device tree for the ASUS ZenFone 8 (sake).

[Kernel repo](https://github.com/mikooomich/android_kernel_asus_sm8350)

### Notes
For more information, install instructions, and changelogs, check out the [forum post](https://xdaforums.com/t/unofficial-a14-sake-lineageos-21.4641226/). Downloads can be found in the releases section.


Branches suffixed in `-staging` are the testing branches where I attempt experimental things stuff and see what's sticks. Borrowing a quote from [Terminator-J](https://github.com/Terminator-J), "Warning: I force push like a cracked-out Jedi".


The `-libperf` branch attempts to port libperfmgr to this device. *Currently this is untested.*
